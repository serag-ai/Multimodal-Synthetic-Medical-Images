# Investigating Diffusion Models Across Diverse Imaging Modalities 🌐

### AI Innovation Lab, Weill Cornell Medicine - Qatar

## ✨ Overview
This study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of generating synthetic medical images using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) while preserving important imaging biomarkers. These synthetic images hold promise for advancing various applications in healthcare, including:

- AI algorithm development 🤖
- Data augmentation 📈
- Privacy-preserving data sharing 🔒

By bridging the gap between synthetic and real-world medical imaging data, our approach paves the way for future innovations in medical imaging research and clinical practice.
